# kcmsettings-cleanup

This script disables settings normal users wouldn't access. When a better way to organize them was found they will be whitelisted again. They most importantly aren't accessible somewhere else outside the settings.

**Run the script**

```sh
./kcmoverride.sh
```

**Revert the changes**

```sh
./kcmoverride.sh --uninstall
```
